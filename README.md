# Stock Price Prediction Using ARIMA

This project demonstrates how to predict stock prices using historical data and the **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model. The dataset consists of daily stock prices for Apple Inc. (`AAPL`) sourced from **Yahoo Finance**. The project focuses on time series modeling, prediction, and evaluation using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## üìñ Project Overview

### **Objective**
- Predict Apple Inc.'s future stock prices using the ARIMA model.
- Evaluate model accuracy using RMSE and visualize predictions against actual data.

### **Key Features**
- **Data Source**: Historical stock data fetched directly from Yahoo Finance.
- **Preprocessing**: Focus on closing prices, handle missing values, and prepare the data for time series analysis.
- **Modeling**: Fit the ARIMA model to training data and forecast future prices.
- **Evaluation**: Assess model performance with RMSE.
- **Visualization**: Compare historical prices with model predictions using matplotlib.
